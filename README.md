# 🐋 One-Stop Guide for Using BlueROV with Ubuntu

> 📌 _Author: Bakel Bakel | Version: 1.0 | Last Updated: May 2025_

## ⚠️ Prerequisites

This guide is specifically written for **Ubuntu Linux users**. It is **not** intended for users running:

- **Windows**
- **MacOS**
- **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**
- **VMware / VirtualBox / Any virtual machine setup**

BlueROV’s software stack relies on direct hardware access and reliable networking, which can be inconsistent or restricted in virtualized environments.

**✅ Recommendation:**  
For best results, install Ubuntu Linux natively on your machine. You can either:

- **Install Ubuntu as your main OS**, or
- **Dual boot alongside Windows or macOS**

> 💡 _This documentation was created and tested on **Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS**. However, any recent Ubuntu version (20.04 and above) should work just as well._
