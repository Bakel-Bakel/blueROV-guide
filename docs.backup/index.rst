BlueROV Guide
===========================

⚠️ Prerequisites
----------------

This guide is specifically written for **Ubuntu Linux users**. It is has **not** been tested for users running:

- **Windows**
- **macOS**
- **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**
- **VMware / VirtualBox / Any virtual machine setup**

BlueROV’s software stack relies on direct hardware access and reliable networking, which can be inconsistent or restricted in virtualized environments.

.. note::

   **✅ Recommendation:**  
   For best results, install Ubuntu Linux natively on your machine. You can either:

   - **Install Ubuntu as your main OS**, or  
   - **Dual boot alongside Windows or macOS**

.. hint::

   This documentation was created and tested on **Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS**. However, any recent Ubuntu version (20.04 and above) should work just as well.
